WELCOME TO GSAP + SCROLLTRIGGER PROJECT!

After the two other projects available in my git of animated landing pages using GSAP Library, I decided to built a project in which I would animate more than one section. To be able to do that I used ScrollTrigger, a GSAP Plugin that allows you to trigger your animations depending on your scrolling and the position of the window you are at every moment.

The project consists of just three sections in which the design was not the main priority. Doing different kind of animations and understanding the plugin was the purpose of building this website.

Another thing I included was a very minimalist svg animation with css to simulate the page is loading.

The images and video could have been optimized for the web to be faster as I have learned by doing it in other projects.
